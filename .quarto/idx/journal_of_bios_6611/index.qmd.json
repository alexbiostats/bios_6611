Articles may include exploration of theorems discussed in class, evaluation of test properties under various assumptions, illustration of power calculations for unique problems, or other applications where simulation studies may be of interest.\n\n*  **Brief reports:** these articles are short analyses to answer a research question from real world data. Articles must include at least one use of resampling (either *bootstrap resampling* to describe the variability of parameters of interest or *permutation testing* to calculate a p-value).\n\n\n# Preparation\n\n## File Formats\nArticles should be submitted in a format compatible with [Canvas SpeedGrader](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/What-types-of-files-can-be-previewed-in-Canvas/ta-p/607) (e.g., DOCX or PDF). \n\nPreferably, articles will be written using R Markdown. All files will ultimately be converted to PDF for inclusion in the journal issue disseminated internally within the class. \n\n\n## Page Limits\n**Simulation studies** have an expected page length of at least 1.5 pages and no more than 2 pages. \n\n**Brief reports** have an expected page length of at least 2.5 pages and no more than 3 pages. \n\nThese pages limits include the required figure(s) and table(s), but not references. \n\n\n## Font Size and Spacing\nUse a standard font size and any standard font. Articles should be single spaced.\n\n\n## Title and Author Information\nThe article should have an informative title. Additionally, author information should include:\n\n* Author name\n* Author degrees\n* Author affiliation (e.g., BIOS MS Student, EPID MPH Student, Baisy's Lab, etc.)\n\n\n## Abstract and Keywords\nA short abstract should describe the problem, data, and results.\n\nImmediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 5 keywords, avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.\n\n\n## Article Body Structure\nArticles should follow a similar structure to that outlined below:\n\n* Introduction, Background\n* Motivating Problem, Theorem Description (for simulation studies); Materials and Methods, Study Design (for brief reports)\n* Simulation Set-up, Statistical Methods, Statistical Analyses\n* Results\n* Discussion, Conclusion\n\nNote, these exact names do not need to be used and can be customized to your given article, analysis, and context.\n\n\n## Tables and Figures\nAll tables and figures should be \"publication ready\" with informative titles and labels. Where applicable, units of measurement should be included. Variable names from code should be replaced with meaningful labels (e.g., instead of \"outcome_variable4\" write the actual outcome). \n\n**Simulation studies** must include at least one table and one figure, but more may be included. These count towards the two page limit.\n\n**Brief reports** must include a \"Table 1\" that describes the study population as well as at least one figure. Additional tables and figures may be included as necessary to present and summarize results. These count towards the three page limit.\n\n\n## Decimal Numerals\nTo enhance readability and clarity of the text as well as tables and figures, decimal numerals should - with the obvious exception of P-values - be rounded to the unit whenever possible (i.e. in all cases in which the rounding procedure does not change the meaning). \n\n\n## Acknowledgments\nCollate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).\n\n\n## References\nAny style of reference is acceptable as long as formatting is consistent.\n\n\n## Supplemental Materials\nGiven the small page limits, it is acceptable to include *additional* tables and figures beyond the required minimum of one table and one figure in a Supplemental Materials section if needed. These figures and tables should be referenced in the text as **Figure S1**, **Table S1**, etc. \n\nWhile you should direct the reader to the Supplemental Materials to access the additional tables, figures, or information, the paper itself should be able to be largely understood as though a reader did not have access to the supplement.\n\n\n## Reproducible Research Principles\nAn *appendix* with R, SAS, or other code should be included starting on a new page after your references with code that is clearly commented for the simulations, analyses, figures, and tables ultimately included in the report. Code that was ultimately not used in the final report should be excluded from this appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Introduction\nThe *Journal of BIOS 6611* is the official internal publication of the Biostatistical Methods I course at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
